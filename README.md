I developed this project with ASP .NET MVC5, one of the current development tools in the industry. This Project My First Back-End Project with ASP .NET MVC5. I have another project with Django Framework. I used HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery templates in Front-End side of the Project. I tried to write code in the correct format, without crushing Solid principles as much as possible. I developed my project in 4 basic layers : Business, Data Access, Entity and Presentation.
